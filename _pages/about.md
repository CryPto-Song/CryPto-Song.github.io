I am currently a fifth year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (2017-Present), fortunately advised by Prof. [Vipul Goyal](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/). My research interest is theoretic cryptography and its application in the real world, especially the efficient multi-party computation. 

This summer, I am an intern at NTT Research, Sunnyvale and work with Prof. [Vipul Goyal](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/) on the communication-efficient multi-party computation.

In Summer 2020, I was an intern in the AI Research team at J.P. Morgan, New York and worked with [Antigoni Polychroniadou](https://antigonip.github.io) on the communication-efficient multi-party computation. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Yao Class (2013-2017), Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate, I visited Aarhus University in Spring 2016 and workd with [Claudio Orlandi](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/) on order revealing encryption.
